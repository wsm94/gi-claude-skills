## Usage

### Triggering a Skill

Skills activate when you use specific phrases or keywords:

**Product Manager Skill:**
```
"Help me write a PRD for a notification system"
"Act as a product manager and define requirements"
"Create a PRD for user authentication"
```

**General Pattern:**
- Use natural language that matches the skill's domain
- Mention key terms from the skill description
- Start with action verbs: "Help me...", "Create...", "Generate..."

### Environment-Specific Behavior

Skills can adapt based on where you're using Claude:

| Environment | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| **VS Code** | Accesses codebase, explores files, suggests integrations |
| **Desktop** | Creates artifacts, interactive mockups, downloads |
| **Web** | Creates artifacts, interactive mockups *(when supported)* |

**Example - Product Manager Skill:**

**In VS Code:**
```
"Help me write a PRD for API rate limiting"
‚Üí Explores your codebase structure
‚Üí Identifies tech stack and patterns
‚Üí Generates PRD with technical integration details
```

**In Desktop:**
```
"Help me write a PRD for a settings page"
‚Üí Asks about UI requirements
‚Üí Creates interactive UI mockups (React components)
‚Üí Generates PRD with mockup links
```

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows this standard structure:

```
skill-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md              # Main instructions (required)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YAML frontmatter  # Name and description

## Verifying Installation

### Check Skill Files

```bash
# Desktop (macOS)
ls ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/skills/product-manager/

# Desktop (Windows)
dir %APPDATA%\Claude\skills\product-manager

# VS Code
ls ~/.claude/skills/product-manager/

# WSL
ls /mnt/skills/user/product-manager/
```

**Expected output:**
```
SKILL.md
references/
```

### Test the Skill

1. Open Claude in your environment
2. Start a new conversation
3. Use a trigger phrase (e.g., "Help me write a PRD for...")
4. Claude should acknowledge and use the skill

**Signs the skill is working:**
- Claude mentions skill-specific terminology
- Follows the skill's workflow/process
- References skill documentation

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Loading

**Problem:** Claude doesn't seem to use the skill

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify file location:**
   ```bash
   # Check the skill is in the right directory
   ls <skills-directory>/product-manager/SKILL.md
   ```

2. **Check YAML frontmatter:**
   ```bash
   head -5 <skills-directory>/product-manager/SKILL.md
   ```
   Should show:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: ...
   ---
   ```

3. **Restart Claude:**
   - Desktop: Quit and reopen app
   - VS Code: Reload window (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P ‚Üí "Reload Window")

4. **Try explicit trigger:**
   ```
   "Use the product-manager skill to help me..."
   ```

5. **Check permissions:**
   ```bash
   chmod -R 644 <skills-directory>/product-manager/
   ```

### File Not Found Errors

**Problem:** Claude can't find reference files

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify references directory exists
ls <skills-directory>/product-manager/references/

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod -R 644 <skills-directory>/product-manager/references/
```

### Windows Path Issues

**Problem:** Spaces in path cause errors

**Solution:** Always use quotes:
```powershell
# Wrong
tar -xzf C:\Users\Will Marshall\Downloads\file.tar.gz

# Right
tar -xzf "C:\Users\Will Marshall\Downloads\file.tar.gz"
```

# Restart Claude
```

### Update Individual Files

cp product-manager/SKILL.md product-manager/SKILL.md.backup

# Replace specific file
cp new-SKILL.md product-manager/SKILL.md

# Restart Claude
```

---

## FAQ

### Q: Can I use the same skill in multiple environments?

**A:** Yes! Install the skill in each environment's skills directory. The skill can adapt its behavior based on available capabilities.

### Q: How many skills can I install?

**A:** No hard limit, but Claude can access ~100+ skills efficiently. Too many may slow skill selection.

### Q: Do skills work offline?

**A:** Skills are local files, but Claude needs internet to process requests. Once loaded, skill instructions are cached.

### Q: Can I modify existing skills?

**A:** Yes! Skills are plain markdown files. Edit SKILL.md to customize behavior. Keep backups before modifying.

### Q: How do I share skills with my team?

**A:** Package as `.tar.gz` or share the skill directory. Recipients install in their skills directory.

### Q: Can skills access my data?

**A:** Skills are instructions for Claude, not executable code. They guide Claude's behavior but don't independently access files.

### Q: What if two skills conflict?

**A:** Claude chooses the most relevant skill based on your request. Use explicit triggers ("Use skill-name to...") to force a specific skill.

### Q: Are skills sandboxed?

**A:** In VS Code/WSL, skills can guide Claude to execute code. In Desktop, skills create artifacts but don't execute code.
